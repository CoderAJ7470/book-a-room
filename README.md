A room-booking app I made by following a video on the Traversy Media channel on Youtube.

This has been built with React, Next.js, Appwrite and Tailwind CSS.

Kind of a "ledger" of notes as I am doing this project (stuff I encounter as I follow Brad's tutorial and either fix it or just make a note of it for future reference):

- First and foremost, there have been some changes to how Appwrite does things (some of them occurred as I was following this tutorial!). If you also follow this tutorial, make sure you read my notes below. Pretty much all of my notes are in the timeline-order i.e. I've made the notes as I followed the video (for the most part anyway, except for the first point below).

- This first note has to do with Appwrite keys, and how the video tells you to name the endpoints you will need in the env.local file. You can indeed follow everything as-is for this file when he shows all that stuff, but beware that Appwrite has now renamed "Collections" to "Tables", "Attributes" to "Columns" and "Documents" to "Rows". This change was done so Appwrite's database naming is consistent with general DB terminology. The env.local file endpoints will still have "COLLECTION" in a few of the endpoint names since this video was made well before these Appwrite changes. This is ok as those endpoints will point to the Table you have created. Everything's still the same, just that the naming conventions have changed.

There are additional minor changes regarding the keys - keep reading below ðŸ™ƒ

- In the page component under "app/rooms/[id]", I got the following warning:
  "Route "/rooms/[id]" used `params.id`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties."

  To fix this issue, I simply made the component function async (by adding the keyword before the parentheses just like with a normal function) and then used the await keyword before the params, to wait for the params to fully come back before accessing the id from them. This is the official way of fixing this issue as per NextJS's documentation.

- Regarding the Appwrite environment keys - a few things have changed since Brad uploaded the video I am follwing. The NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT has changed and now includes the region you specify during the initial Appwrite setup. To get the whole endpoint easily, you just need to go to the "Overview" page (accessed by clicking the "Overview" button on the left hand side of your Appwrite database page), then click the region at the top to copy and use it for the value of NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT in your .env.local file.

- Next to that, you will also find your Appwrite project's ID - you can click that as well to copy/paste it for your NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT value, again which will be placed in your .env.local file.

- Since we are using NextJS, we cannot just install the Appwrite SDK - that would be the case if we were building a single page application (SPA). In this case, since we are using NextJS, we need to run the following command when installing Appwrite: npm i node-appwrite

- Server actions: the new and improved way to do things, instead of using API routes when pulling in data from your database

- We are creating middleware to protect certain routes, like the route for the Bookings page, My Rooms page, Add Rooms page etc. Middleware - essentially one or more functions that has/have access to the request/response cycle - sits between the server and client

- In the video, it is mentioned that we need to use the revalidatePath function in createNewRoom.js, to ensure that the cache is refreshed. This is to ensure that when the user is re-directed back to the home page a.k.a. Rooms page from the "Add a Room" page, the room that was just added is automatically shown to the user i.e. the user does not have to refresh the page manually to show the newly-added room. Couple of observations about this function:

  - This function throws an error similar to the following when used as shown in the video: "Route / used "revalidatePath /" during render which is unsupported. To ensure revalidation is performed consistently it must always happen outside of renders and cached functions." I was unable to figure out exactly why this is happening, as I am clearly calling it in a file that has 'use server' and did it exactly as shown in the video. After a lot of research, I resorted to wrapping revalidatePath inside a call to [after](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/after).
  - However, it seems that this is not needed after all, since I am able to see new rooms that are added via the "Add a Room" page when I get re-directed back to the Rooms page, immediately after adding a new room. Indeed, a simple console.log inside the after() does not even appear in the browser console. Removing the after with the call to revalidatePath inside it does not break anything either, and I am still able to see the newly-added room on the Rooms page.
  - My thinking is, because we await the call to createDocument() in createNewRoom.js, the new room data first create the new room's entry in the Appwrite DB "rooms" collection, then our application state gets updated, and only then do we get re-directed back to the Rooms page. Which calls our getAllRooms() action, but by then the new room is already in the DB and gets shown as part of all the room in the DB. So revalidatePath() is not required here.
  - **_ However _** - I did in fact have to use revalidatePath a couple of times
    - Once in bookRoom.js, after we create the new booking. It works just fine here and no errors are thrown
    - Also in getAllRooms.js - here we call it twice, once to revalidate the cache for the /rooms/my path, and once again for the home path (/). And again, no errors are thrown and it works fine. I am not sure why it works in these two files but not in createNewRoom.js. Will be a research excercise for sure. If I find the root cause of the issue, I will try to remember to update this file with my findings.

- ## Some notes about the Bookings section of the tutorial (begins at 3:08:00):
  - Appwrite stores the time you send it (in this case, from the time input fields) in UTC time. If you do not ensure to first convert that time to local time using the Date constructor, the time you choose from those fields will be converted to UTC - the difference of your local time zone plus or minus UTC. E.g. if you choose 11:00 AM as the check-in time when you go to book a room, AND your time zone is US Central, the time that's actually getting stored as local time will be 6:00 AM, as currently we are in Daylight savings time (CDT). To prevent this from occurring, you have to pass the time chosen to Date i.e. create a new Date. See bookRoom.js for more clarity.
  - Similarly, the time you get from Appwrite when you want to show the check-in/check-out times in local time will again be in local time + or - UTC. You will again have to do some time-conversion stuff to get the time in local time format. See MyBookingsCard.jsx to see how to do this properly.
